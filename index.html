      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 30 years old and recently got married in October to my beautiful wife Emily. I am a front-end web developer who primarily uses HTML and CSS coding languages. I work for a company called Oitmain in Buena Park.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in sunny California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>One of my long time hobbyies is playing video games but over the past couple years I've been enjoying another hobby away from the screen and that is hiking. It's been really nice getting outside and heading to the mountains from time to time.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Good question! I can't really answer it that easily. If I had to give one, I would say that my dream job would to be a Web Developer that can do it all!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm currently living in the pleasant city of Yorba Lina.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always had a passion for the web and we live in a time where eveything is depending on the web and programs. It amazes me what technologies are out there and how the industry is evolving and I want to be a part of that.</p>
